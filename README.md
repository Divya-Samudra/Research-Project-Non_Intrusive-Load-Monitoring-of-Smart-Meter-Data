# Research-Project-Non_Intrusive-Load-Monitoring-of-Smart-Meter-Data
In this project Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring of Smart Meter Data using Ant Colony Optimization method is implemented. In the first step, conforming loads or consumers are identified and then load disaggregation is done. Refer the file NILM_Divya M.pdf for details.
